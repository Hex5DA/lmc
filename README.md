# Little Man Computer Emulator

I'm bored so I wrote a LMC emulator. Based off of this spec:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer>

This also includes a ""programming language"" (exaggeration) which ""compiles"" (exaggeration) to run on the virtual ""cpu"" (exaggeration)

Still neat though.

Will refactor & document later on :)

It isn't fully true to the ""standard"" (ex. data is stored as u64 not 0-999)

But it was fun to make ^^
